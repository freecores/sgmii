<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "lpbff.v" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of dcfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "lpbff.v".  The design "lpbff.v" has a depth of 512 words of 36 bits each. The fifo is in show-ahead synchronous mode.  The data becomes available before 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read acknowledge. </P>

<P><FONT size=3>The above waveform shows the behavior of the FIFO under wrfull condition. In the example above, data is written into the FIFO till it is full, then data is read back. </P>
